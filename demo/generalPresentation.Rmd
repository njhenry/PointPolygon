# Background

---

# Child Mortality and the Millenium Development Goals

- "... the Persistence ofdisparities in infant mortality rates throughout this century, mirroring the persistence of larger social and economic inequalities in the United States" (Gormaker & Wise 1997)
- Child mortality as an indictor for
    - Maternal health
    - Access to care
    - General public health
    - Morbidity and early life adversity
- Mellenium Development Goals (MDGs)
    - Reduce child mortality by two thirds

---

# The Lasting Effects of MDGs

- Comparative health-systems studies (Horton 2006)
    - The importance of strengthening health systems
    - Evidence based implmentation
    - Strong importance on understanding data landscape
- Countdown to 2015 (Victoria et al 2016)
    - The importance of multiple stakeholders in monitoring processes
    - Linking interventions to health improvments
    - Planning for future goals

# Limitations of the National Context: Inequality

- Country level studies mask variation within the country (Hosseinpoor 2016)
    - Need for unmasking geographic differences in health
    - Deploy equity oriented interventions
- Precision public health (Desmond-Hellmann 2016)
- Recent studies point to growing levels of health inequalities by subnational measures
    - Rising inequality in United States county level mortality (Dwyer-Lindgren 2017)
    - Differential gains in Sub-Saharan Africa under five mortality (Burke 2016)

# Spatial Analysis of Under 5 Mortality

- Leverage spatial auto-correlation in health events to get better informed estimates
- Classic example Clayton and Kaldor 1987 Socttish Lip Cancer

# Spatial Analysis of Under 5 Mortality

- Leverage spatial auto-correlation in health events to get better informed estimates
- Classic example Clayton and Kaldor 1987 Socttish Lip Cancer
    - Pooling information across space improves estimates
    - Different observavtions give us different levels of information
    - Similar things tend to cluster in space
    
---
# Spatial Mechenisms of Health Outcomes
- Access to health facilities
- Neighborhood characteristics and early life adversity
- Clustered socio-economic characteristics
    - Quality of education
    - Economic standing 
    - [Racial/ethnic clustering](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html)

# Limitations to Current Analysis of Geospatial Child Mortality
- Data must be sufficiently geocoded
    - Known enumeration areas from MICS/DHS
    - Geolocatted data points
- Data must come in the form of complete birth histories
    - Summary birth histories
    - Vital Registration may also be used if comprehensive
- Data must be represenative of the locations they sample

---
# DHS and MICS Studies
- United States Agency for International Development / UNICEF funded
- Monitor changes in health in developing countries
    - Countries that do not have comprehensive registration systems
- Collect data on a number of health indicators including CBH of women in households
- Relatively small portion of the data is geolocated
    - 25% of person years observed are geolocated
    - 75% are representative of some national/subnational level
    - Data is still collected in similar survey scheme
    
---
# Proposal 
- Introduce a new method for incorporating clustered obscured data in spatial analysis
- Compare against gold standard of knowing where data comes from 
- Compare against ingoring the data completely 
- Comapre against previously stated methods
- Comparison framework
    - Simulate spatio-temporal field of underlying probabilities
    - Sample from the field at random
    - Obscure locations for some samples representative of a particular area
    - Validate on error and coverage metrics

# Method

---
# Data Collection Process for MICS/DHS
- Two stage sampling process
- Divide country of concern into stratifications
    - Administrative areas
    - Urban/Rural
- Using enumeration areas as a frame sample areas within a startification 
- Sample households from within the enumeration areas selected
- Usually not sampled at random and weights are given to samples
- Weights reflect representation of a given stratified area
- CBH give us retrospective samples

---
# An Example Case: Dominican Republic
- Historically incomplete VR for child births and deaths
- Number of surveys on complete birth history (CBH)
- DHS 2007 & 2013: Complete Spatial information given for CBH
- MICS 2014: Cluster location removed for CBH know only up to stratification

# Traditional Spatial Modeling Approach
- Continous model of underlying spatial risk
- Allows for arbitrary aggregation to adminstrative levels

$$Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(p_{s_i, t_i}, N_i) \\ \text{logit}(p_{s_i, t_i}) = \boldsymbol{\beta \cdot X_{s_i, t_i}} + \omega(s_i, t_i) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega} \sim \mathcal{GP}(\boldsymbol{0}, \mathcal{M} \otimes\text{AR1}) \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}~\dot \sim~ \text{GMRF}(\boldsymbol{0}, Q^\mathcal{M} \otimes Q^\text{AR1}) \\ \kappa \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \tau \sim \text{Log Normal}(0, 10) \\ \rho \sim \text{Logit Normal}(0, 10)$$
